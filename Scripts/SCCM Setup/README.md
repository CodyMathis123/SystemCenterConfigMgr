These scripts let you configure SCCM to quickly build out an environment.  Super useful for lab environments.

SUP_ADR_Creation.ps1
Creates ADRs based on a set of rules (edit the PS1 to configure the ADRs you want to deploy).
As default requires that the dogfood (phased deployment) collections be imported first.

SUP_UpdateSelection.ps1
Sets the updates that SCCM targets to import.
